Aggregate information may be used in any way approved by the Digital Health Division for trend analyses and analytics that are not yet specified in this policy. In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII. If we combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated as PII.

In certain circumstances, we may contact the user directly via their email address(es) and/or phone number(s) to confirm validity and/or receipt of the information.</p><h4 data-v-5cb50d47>2.2.3 Administrative Matters</h4><p data-v-5cb50d47> The Digital Health Division reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the Ministry of Health’s Privacy Policy or to notify you of other administrative matters in connection with any of our Apps and/or services that you are currently using or have once used. It is the responsibility of the user to provide us with accurate information and to make sure that any changes are understood. </p><h4 data-v-5cb50d47>2.2.4 Other Purposes</h4><p data-v-5cb50d47>We may disclose your information:</p><h4 data-v-5cb50d47>2.2.4.1</h4><p data-v-5cb50d47>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.

While the Digital Health Division takes all appropriate steps to safeguard PII under our control, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As such, we cannot guarantee that PII &amp; Non-PII supplied by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of interception, alteration or misuse of information during such transfers. If you have reason to believe that there has been any breach of the security of any of our Apps and/or servers, please contact us immediately at software-developers@kuunika.org</p><p data-v-5cb50d47>We know it is very important to protect the information you share with us. We take appropriate data and information security measures to help safeguard this information from unauthorised access and disclosure. For example, only authorised employees / consultants / teams are allowed access to Digital Health Division&#39;s servers and with appropriate privileges only. Once a UID has been generated, it is used between the application(s) and the server without the need of passing PII. Cloud Messaging tokens are refreshed on a regular basis to avoid intrusion via unnecessary push notifications that could be used by a hacker who has obtained the list of tokens and access key. SSL certificates have been installed on all our servers. We make use of symmetric cryptography to secure data passed in between our Apps.</p><p data-v-5cb50d47>However, <i data-v-5cb50d47>security is a process and not a product</i> and no system can be completely secure, we design our Apps with information security as one of the priorities.</p><h2 data-v-5cb50d47>5.0 - Offline vs. Online practices</h2><p data-v-5cb50d47>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies solely to our online information gathering and dissemination practices in connection with our Apps, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline.</p><h2 data-v-5cb50d47>6.0 - Use of Our Apps by Children</h2><p data-v-5cb50d47>Our Apps are not directed to individuals under the age of sixteen (16) without parental consent, and we request that such individuals do not provide PII through any of our Apps. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without the parent or guardian’s consent by, for example, misrepresenting his or her age, that parent or guardian should contact us at softwaredevelopers@kuunika.org. If the Digital Health Division determines that it has collected personal information of children under the age of 13, Digital Health Division will immediately delete such information and any accounts believed to be held by children under 13.</p><h2 data-v-5cb50d47>7.0 - Accessing, Updating or Deleting Information Collected About You</h2><p data-v-5cb50d47>Digital Health Division has the right to change any information pertaining to the user, both PII and Non-PII under certain circumstances which warrant such a change as determined by internal team(s) without giving notice to the user. Some information is collected automatically by our Apps and as such it is able to detect a change made by the user and carry out an automatic update. Please note that although this information will not be available on our Apps after you cease to use them, the information may remain stored indefinitely on our servers, both main and backup, and as such we cannot always ensure that these corrections or deletions will reach such other storage facilities in a timely manner.</p><h2 data-v-5cb50d47>8.0 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679</h2><p data-v-5cb50d47>Digital Health Division complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR EU 2016/679) for users who are using our Services and/or Apps and are residents and/or citizens of the countries mentioned in this regulation.
