While the Digital Health Division takes all appropriate steps to safeguard PII under our control, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As such, we cannot guarantee that PII &amp; Non-PII supplied by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of interception, alteration or misuse of information during such transfers.

We take appropriate data and information security measures to help safeguard this information from unauthorised access and disclosure. For example, only authorised employees / consultants / teams are allowed access to Digital Health Division&#39;s servers and with appropriate privileges only. Once a UID has been generated, it is used between the application(s) and the server without the need of passing PII. Cloud Messaging tokens are refreshed on a regular basis to avoid intrusion via unnecessary push notifications that could be used by a hacker who has obtained the list of tokens and access key.
